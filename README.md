# Energy Usage Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing the correlation between weather conditions in Dublin and energy consumption in a house in Dundalk. With sustainability being a significant focus in the EU, reducing energy consumption for greater energy efficiency has become a primary objective. This analysis aims to provide insights into how weather and temperature influence energy usage to drive optimal energy management strategies.

## Datasets

The project utilizes three real-world datasets:

- hourly_dublin_17_18_19: Hourly weather data from Dublin for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019.
- JLHome1718Power: Hourly energy consumption data from a home in Dundalk.
- JLHome1718Temperature: Temperature data recorded in the Dundalk home.

## Objectives

- Investigate the relationship between energy consumption and external factors such as temperature and weather conditions.
- Derive insights that can contribute to energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives.
- Leverage data analysis techniques to identify patterns and anomalies in energy usage.

## Approach
1. Data Cleaning: Clean and merge datasets, handle missing values, and perform data wrangling, including creating new variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Create visualisations to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between variables.
3. Prediction: Perform simple and multiple linear regression analysis to predict energy usage.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the R Markdown file scripts in R.
